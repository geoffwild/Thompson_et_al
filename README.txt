This archive contains several files.
###### 
FILENAME: appended-fig.py
DESCRIPTION: A Python script that (a) generates the data used to plot Figure A.1 of Appendix A, and (b) plots said figure. The file simulates the dynamics described in Appendix A, using the assumptions set out in that appendix. 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS: Run on a Windows 10 laptop computer with Python 3.7.4 (64-bit). The script requires numpy. Both Python and numpy can be installed for free as part of the Anaconda package (anaconda.org). The script can also be run through a browser using the Google Colab tool (colab.research.google.com), though, to be clear, we did not do this.   

######
FILENAME: main-fig-data.csv
DESCRIPTION: A comma-delimited data file output by main-fig.data.py. Contains the data that are plotted by the script main-fig-draw.py.
###### 
FILENAME: main-fig-data.py
DESCRIPTION: A Python script that generates the data used to plot Figure 4 of the main text. The file simulates the dynamics described in Appendix A, using the assumptions set out in that appendix and set out in Example II. The script writes the data to a file named “main-fig-data.csv” that is also contained in the archive.
ADDITIONAL DETAILS: Run on a Windows 10 laptop computer with Python 3.7.4 (64-bit). The script requires numpy. Both Python and numpy can be installed for free as part of the Anaconda package (anaconda.org). The script can also be run through a browser using the Google Colab tool (colab.research.google.com), though we did not do this.
